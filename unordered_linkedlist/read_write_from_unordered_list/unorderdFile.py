Take a user input to search a Word in the List. If the Word is not found then add it
to the list, and if it found then remove the word from the List. In the end save the
list into a file
b. I/P 足> Read from file the list of Words and take user input to search a Text
c. Logic 足> Create a Unordered Linked List. The Basic Building Block is the Node
